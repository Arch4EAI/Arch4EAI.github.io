However, the computing stack that supports these embodied AI robots is lagging behind. This workshop aims to take the first step in bridging the gap between the computer architecture and robotics communities.</p> <p>The goal of building an efficient computing stack for embodied AI robots echoes what our field has achieved over the past decades: faster, more energy-efficient chips. Yet the challenges here are fundamentally different. Workloads are evolving rapidly, model inference demands are novel, real-time constraints are stringent, safety and reliability requirements are critical, and robots run out of power fast. This emerging domain presents a host of new and exciting challenges. Through this workshop, we aim to highlight these topics and bring them to the attention of the computer architecture community.</p> <p>The program will feature a mix of invited talks and contributed posters. We welcome submissions from all related areas\u2014please refer to the CFP below for more details.</p> Call For Papers Topics of Interest <p>In general, we welcome system designers and researchers on <code>robotic computing</code> to join this workshop and present their ongoing works.

Nevertheless, a suitable computing substrate for autonomous machines is missing, and many companies are forced to develop ad hoc computing solutions that are neither principled nor extensible. By analyzing the demands of autonomous machine computing, this talk introduces Dataflow Accelerator Architecture (DAA), a modern instantiation of the classic dataflow principle, that matches the characteristics of autonomous machine software, such as embodied AI systems.</p> <p>Biography:</p> <p>Professor Jean-Luc Gaudiot is currently Distinguished Professor in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at the University of California, Irvine where he was department Chair from 2003 to 2009. During his tenure, the department underwent significant changes. These include the hiring of twelve new faculty members (three senior professors) and the remarkable rise in the US News and World Report rankings of both the Computer Engineering program and the Electrical Engineering program. From 1999 to 2002, he was the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Computers. He served as the 2017 IEEE Computer Society President. He is a Fellow of IEEE and AAAS.</p> Vijay Janapa Reddi <p>Talk Title: TBD</p> <p>Abstract: TBD</p> <p>Biography: TBD</p> OGATA Tetsuya <p>Talk Title: TBD</p> <p>Abstract: TBD</p> <p>Biography: TBD</p> Zhenhua Zhu <p>Talk Title: TBD</p> <p>Abstract: TBD</p> <p>Biography: TBD</p> Poster and Light Talk <p>Note: Each presenter should prepare a 2-minute slides and an A0 poster.</p> Time Name Title 16:10 - 16:12 Tong Zhang Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design for Robotic Edge Intelligence: CIM-Optimized CNN Architectures with Adaptive Kernel Scaling 16:12 - 16:14 Shunchen Shi Mixed-Precision Processing-in-Memory Architecture for Edge Device LLM Inference 16:14 - 16:16 Wenhao Sun Investigating Performance and Real-Time Trade-offs in Out-of-Order Processors 16:16 - 16:18 Jieke Lin KAITIAN: Communication for Heterogeneous Accelerators in Embodied AI 16:18 - 16:20 Haining Tan Co-Design of Vision Transformers and Accelerators for Efficient Inference on Spaceborne Edge Devices 16:20 - 16:30 Q&amp;A Session Q&amp;A Session Time Activity 16:20 - 16:30 Open Discussion and Q&amp;A Contact Us <p>Any questions may be directed to: ganyiming@ict.ac.cn</p>"}]}
