As robots evolve from executing predefined tasks to engaging in complex, real-world interactions, there is an urgent need for new computing systems that can meet these growing demands. This workshop is both timely and essential, aiming to bridge the gap between robotics, algorithms, and computing systems, fostering collaboration to advance the next generation of intelligent robots.</p> <p>Embodied AI marks a critical paradigm shift, where intelligence transcends isolated algorithms and becomes deeply integrated with physical systems capable of sensing, perceiving, and interacting with their environment. This shift aims to transform robots from specialized tools designed for specific tasks into adaptable, general-purpose agents capable of operating across diverse scenarios, and becomes a perfect application that integrates large-scale language model inference with robotic localization and control.</p> <p>However, the primary challenge in this emerging field lies in developing computing systems that can support embodied agents in real time\u2014managing diverse workloads while balancing computational power, energy efficiency, and latency to meet the demands of dynamic environments. These systems must facilitate seamless coordination across components such as localization, planning, perception, and reliability, spanning client devices, edge platforms, and the cloud. They must also accommodate natural language-based interactions instead of traditional programming interfaces, further elevating the need for real-time, adaptive control. Addressing these challenges requires new architectures, algorithms, and cross-layer co-design, which highlights the importance and timeliness of this workshop.</p> <p>Our primary goal is to bring together computing systems researchers with a focus on robotics, offering a platform for building innovative systems that support embodied AI. We warmly invite participation from diverse domains, including robotics and algorithms, and place particular emphasis on engaging real-world robot designers and manufacturers to share their insights and practical experiences.</p> <p>This workshop is designed to be accessible to all attendees, requiring no specific prerequisites. We aim to create an inclusive environment where participants from various fields can exchange ideas, discuss challenges, and explore opportunities, ultimately laying the groundwork for future innovations in embodied AI systems.</p>"},{"location":"#call-for-papers","title":"Call For Papers","text":""},{"location":"#topics-of-interest","title":"Topics of Interest","text":"<p>In general, we welcome system designers and researchers on <code>robotic computing</code> to join this workshop and present their on-going works.
