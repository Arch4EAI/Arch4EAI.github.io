However, the computing stack that supports these embodied AI robots is lagging behind. This workshop aims to take the first step in bridging the gap between the computer architecture and robotics communities. The goal of building an efficient computing stack for embodied AI robots echoes what our field has achieved over the past decades: faster, more energy-efficient chips. Yet the challenges here are fundamentally different. Workloads are evolving rapidly, model inference demands are novel, real-time constraints are stringent, safety and reliability requirements are critical, and robots run out of power fast. This emerging domain presents a host of new and exciting challenges. Through this workshop, we aim to highlight these topics and bring them to the attention of the computer architecture community. The program will feature a mix of invited talks and contributed posters. We welcome submissions from all related areas\u2014please refer to the CFP below for more details.</p>"},{"location":"#call-for-papers","title":"Call For Papers","text":""},{"location":"#topics-of-interest","title":"Topics of Interest1.
